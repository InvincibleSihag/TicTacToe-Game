# TicTacToe-Game
This was my first Pyhton project, i write this code when i was in 12th class.
This is GUI Tic Tac Toe 2 player game written in python.

# Required Libraries

Pygame - for sound
Tkinter - For Graphical Interface

# What i will add -

Now i am thinking of adding a machine learning model in this game, so that computer can compete with player. This will be very small model, but it will be worth learning.
